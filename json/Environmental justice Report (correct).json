This is a drastic drop from 44 sanctions in 2009 and 159 businesses since 2009. There is a lot of industrial pollution found in the river but little regulation. One problem is that businesses are given notice by CONAGUA before their inspection, letting them manipulate their polluting procedures. The highest fine was issued in 2016 to the Minera Real de Angeles for 3.65 million pesos. Of the sanction companies 37 have repeated offences, up to four times. Federal companies like PEMEX (with 5 sanctions since 2010), several hopitals, and the intermunicipal water system (SIAPA) have been fined. Where Santiago river crosses the municipality of Guadalajara, at least 5,504 of the 9,282 registered businesses strongly pollute. It is believed small and mid-sized businesses pollute the most since they don't have proper waste disposal. Since 2009, Aguascalientes has had 483 sanctions, Nayarit 43, Zacatecas 41, and Jalisco 204.",
